The Program uses python and open cv to create a game. This is an incomplete version which barely works.I will upload the hackathon version by this weekend.The prgram uses Haar classifiers to detect cars.I did also create a colour based algorithm to detect roads however that requires other algorithms to support it inorder to obtain a better level of accuracy.The program detects the uppermost edges of a building and makes mario run on it.Currently No AI has been developed.The program uses pygame.I wish to change this,perhaps even switch from python to c++ as I have found it to be more memory efficient for opencv.I would also like to change the game library from pygame to something else.The Program requires a great amount of work as of yet.All this work was done in the wee hours of the morning at a hackthon so please pardon absence of any comments or good programming technique.All will be updated in time



TO COMPILE:-
Just Run python mario.py in terminal.
